**Welcome to my Github!** 

I am dubz.56, but you can call me dubz.

I upload various projects, ranging from experiments to cybersecurity and intelligence gathering.

Online, I'm known as dubz.56 or simply dubz. My true identity, including personal details like my name and residence, remains a mystery.

I'm deeply interested in cybersecurity, fraud, malware development, programming, and intelligence gathering.

Fluent in English, I'm expanding my horizons by learning Japanese and Korean. I also specialize in OSINT and programming.
